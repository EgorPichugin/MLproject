export const alzgeimerDefinition = `According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, 
neurodegenerative disease that occurs when nerve cells in the brain die.`;

export const alzgeimerSymptoms = `Alzheimer's disease is distinguished from other forms of dementia by characteristic changes in the brain that are 
visible only upon microscopic examination during autopsy.`;

export const mild = `<b>Description:</b><br>
This is the earliest stage of Alzheimer's disease, where subtle changes in cognitive function begin. 
These changes may not yet interfere significantly with daily life.<br>

<b>Symptoms:</b><br>
✔️ Occasional forgetfulness (e.g., misplacing items, forgetting names).<br>
✔️ Slight difficulty in concentration and problem-solving.<br>
✔️ Mild changes in mood or behavior.<br>
✔️ Brain scans may show minimal structural changes.`;

export const moderate = `<b>Description:</b><br>
At this stage, cognitive decline becomes more noticeable, and daily life is 
increasingly affected. The brain shows more visible signs of degeneration.<br>

<b>Symptoms:</b><br>
✔️ Significant memory loss (e.g., forgetting recent events, repeating questions).<br>
✔️ Difficulty recognizing familiar faces or places.<br>
✔️ Struggles with decision-making and planning.<br>
✔️ Changes in mood, personality, or behavior.<br>
✔️ More evident brain shrinkage in X-ray scans.`;

export const severe = `<b>Description:</b><br>\n
This is the most advanced stage of Alzheimer's, where cognitive function is 
severely impaired, and patients require constant care. The brain undergoes significant degeneration.<br>

<b>Symptoms:</b><br>
✔️ Severe memory loss, including inability to recognize close family members.<br>
✔️ Loss of ability to communicate effectively.<br>
✔️ Difficulty swallowing, walking, or performing basic tasks.<br>
✔️ Increased vulnerability to infections and other health complications.<br>
✔️ Extensive brain shrinkage and damage visible in X-ray scans.`;
